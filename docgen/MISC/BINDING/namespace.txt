Namespace for resolving binding
########################

A fmodenv is a quadruple:
(sortenv, sexpenv, dexpenv, d2eclist)

A fmodenv can be given an explicit name or not. If one is not
given a name, then it is said to be an open fmodenv, which is
searched implicitly when a binding is to be resolved.

The searching order is specified as such: the current fmodenv,
the open fmodenvs (introduced via #staload) and the pervasives.
